Follow [these instructions](https://istio.io/docs/setup/install/standalone-operator/) to install the Istio operator. You may wish to use one of the included configuration profiles with Istio. You may optionally apply the included `profile-riser-dev.yaml` profile. This spec has been optimized to reduce the footprint for Riser development.
